# RecipeBookProgram
Program that simulates a text based recipe book and allows to save and export recipe data for later use.

This program was created as a final project for a college level Java programming course.

*Repository inlcudes a couple of folders that contain some recipe object data (./recipe-data) and some exported recipes (./exports).*

*It is not necessary to include them to run the program (RecipeBookProgram), since it should create these folders if they don't already exist.  They are included if you wanted to test some of the functions with pre-loaded recipes.*

*There is also a commented out recipe from within RecipeBookProgram.java for testing the Create Recipe function*
